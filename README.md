# Book Search Engine

## Description

This is a book search engine that allows you to search and find books using a Google Books API. The app is built using React for the front-end functionalities, and Node.js/Express.js for the back-end. It also stores data using MongoDB as its main database, saving user data and book searches on the site.

The app allows users to search for any book and it will return results based on what it finds from Google Books. Searching and reading the descriptions can be done by anybody. However, a user must be logged in in order to save a book to their account! Logged in users have the additional functionality of being able to see their list of books that they saved, either to read later or keep track of what books they have already read. Signing up requires a username, email and password.
